# Download YouTube videos into MP3/MP4
_After years of using suspicious "YouTube To MP3" converters, I decided to make my own so I won't have to visit anymore risky websites :)_

Steps:
1. Run requirements.txt to install the latest yt-dlp version
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Install ffmpeg separately from https://ffmpeg.org/
3. Run the corresponding Python file to download the YouTube video
   ```
   python mp3.py
   ```
   or
   ```
   python mp4.py
   ```
4. Converted videos will be saved into the Downloaded folder

### Enjoy!
